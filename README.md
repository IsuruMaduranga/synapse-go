# Apache Synapse - Go Version

This repository contains the Go language implementation of Apache Synapse. It is developed independently of the main Java-based version.

## Overview

The Go version of Apache Synapse aims to leverage Go's strengths in concurrency and networked services to provide a high-performance, scalable integration engine. This version is designed from the ground up and, as such, diverges significantly from the Java implementation in both architecture and implementation.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
